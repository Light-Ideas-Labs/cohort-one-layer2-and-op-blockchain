# Mechanics of State Channels

## Setting Up a State Channel
Requires participants to lock funds in a multi-signature smart contract on the main chain.

## Off-Chain Transactions
Transactions are conducted off-chain, updating the channel state, which is agreed upon by participants.

## Closing a State Channel
Final state is submitted to the main chain, updating the blockchain with the net result of all off-chain transactions.
