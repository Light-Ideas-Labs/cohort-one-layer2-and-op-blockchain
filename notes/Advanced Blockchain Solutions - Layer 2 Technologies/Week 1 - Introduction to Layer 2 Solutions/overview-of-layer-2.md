# Overview of Layer 2

## Definition and Purpose
Layer 2 solutions are secondary frameworks or protocols built on top of existing blockchain networks to enhance scalability and efficiency by processing transactions off the main blockchain (Layer 1).

## Comparison with Layer 1
While Layer 1 refers to the base blockchain (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum), Layer 2 includes solutions like state channels and sidechains that operate on top of Layer 1 to increase transaction throughput.

## Importance of Scalability
Scalability is crucial for blockchain adoption as it allows for higher transaction rates, reduced congestion, and lower fees, making blockchain applications more practical and user-friendly.
