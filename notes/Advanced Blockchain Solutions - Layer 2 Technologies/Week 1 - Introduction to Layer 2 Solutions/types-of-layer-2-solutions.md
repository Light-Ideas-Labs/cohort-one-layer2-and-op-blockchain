# Types of Layer 2 Solutions

## State Channels
Allow transactions to be conducted off-chain, reducing the load on the main blockchain.

## Sidechains
Independent blockchains that run parallel to the main chain and interact with it via a two-way peg.

## Rollups
Bundle multiple transactions into a single batch processed on the main chain, improving efficiency.

## Plasma
Framework for creating scalable applications by running child chains.

## Validium
Combines elements of ZK-rollups and Plasma to offer scalable and secure off-chain transactions.
