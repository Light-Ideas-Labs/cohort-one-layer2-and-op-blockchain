# Architecture of Optimistic Rollups

## Core Components
- **Sequencers**: Entities that bundle and submit transactions to the main chain.
- **Fraud Proofs**: Mechanisms that allow anyone to challenge the validity of transactions.
- **Verifiers**: Nodes that check the validity of transactions and generate fraud proofs if necessary.

## Transaction Lifecycle
An overview of how transactions are processed, batched, and submitted to the main chain in an optimistic rollup system.

## Data Availability and Security Considerations
Ensuring that data is available and secure while processing transactions off-chain.
