# Fundamentals of Optimistic Rollups

## Definition and Overview
Optimistic rollups are Layer 2 scaling solutions that assume transactions are valid by default but include mechanisms for disputing fraudulent transactions.

## Comparison with Other Layer 2 Solutions
Compared to state channels and sidechains, optimistic rollups offer higher scalability with robust security guarantees.

## Benefits and Challenges
- **Benefits**: Improved scalability, lower transaction fees, and enhanced user experience.
- **Challenges**: Potential delays due to fraud proof periods and the complexity of implementation.
